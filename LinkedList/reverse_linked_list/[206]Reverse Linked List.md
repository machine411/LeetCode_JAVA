# Description

Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:

```
  Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
  Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
```
## Solution:

we could use two way to reverse it.  It also connect the iterative and recursion method.
In a nutshell,
iterative is the repetition of a process 
each repetition of the process is a single iteration
recursion is the thing that defined in terms of itself or its type
It call itself in an infinite number.while it needs a base case and it reduces the other case towards the base case.
### Iterative
Â In traversing the list,We just need change the current nodes pointers to point to its previous element.
 We need to store its previous element beforehand.and other pointer to store the next node before changing the reference.
 time complexity:O(n) (n is the list's length)
 space complexity:O(1)

  /**
   * Definition for singly-linked list.
   * public class ListNode {
   *     int val;
   *     ListNode next;
   *     ListNode() {}
   *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
   *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
   * }
   */
  class Solution {
      public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
      ListNode prev = null;
      ListNode curr = head;
      while (curr !=null){
        ListNode nextTemp = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = nextTemp;
      }
      return prev;
  }
```
### Recursive
  For recursion,we need consider the base case,which is that if head euqal null pr the head's next equal null,we just return head;
  secondly,we need consider a way to make the reverse to close the base case.
  we assume we got a K length linked list.the next time we made it as K-1 length linked list .
  now,we just need to consider that we need store the next node to use in the next recursion step.
  then we call recursion function to that node.
  we made that node to point the pervious node.
  we made the last node point head.
  fially, the head node point null.
  we return the reversedhead.

     *     ListNode next;

     *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
     *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
     * }
     */
    class Solution {
        public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
         if(head == null || head.next ==null)  return head;
          ListNode Nex = head.next;
          ListNode revHead = reverseList(Nex);
          Nex.next = head;
          head.next = null;
          return revHead;
        }
    }
  ```
