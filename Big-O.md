# Big-O
## what is Big O?
 It is the language and metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms.
 
 ;)as speed,which is the metric we use to descibe how fast of any move things,transfer things and so on.
 
## Time Complexity 
  This is the concept of asymptotic runtime.
  
  eg:
   O(N),N is the size of file,which means that the time to transfer will increases linearly with the isze of the file.
   
   O(1) with respect to the size of the file.as the size of the file increases,it won't take any longer to get the file to transfer.The time is constant.
 
   There are the most common ones :O(logN),O(NlogN),O(N),O(N^2),O(2^N)
     
   
 ## Big O,Big Theta,and Big Omega 
  These are both describe runtimes.There are the differences between them:
  O(big O):In academia, big O describes an upper bound on the time
